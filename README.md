# Cozy Laundry Game

Cozy Laundry is a small factory management prototype played in the browser. The interface now focuses on a live dashboard showing key stats alongside a sidebar for orders, construction, upgrades and stats.

## Drag-and-drop Orders

Orders appear in the **Orders** tab of the sidebar. To start work, drag an order card from the list onto an idle machine in the world view. The machine immediately begins processing the job. Use the **Assign** button or press Esc to cancel while dragging.

## Interface

- **HUD** – shows the current day, money, energy and reputation.
- **Dashboard** – shows cash, energy, reputation and order counts at a glance.
- **Sidebar** – switch between orders, building options, upgrades and stats.
- **Help** – keyboard shortcuts and tips are shown at the bottom left.

This repository contains the static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files required to run the demo.
